## AIAgent
An AIAgent is an AI-powered virtual agent that can engage in conversations with prospects. It acts as a digital representative that can be configured with specific roles (like sales or support), personality traits, and knowledge bases. The agent uses natural language processing to understand and respond to conversations while following defined prompts and guidelines.

## Prospects
Prospects represent the contacts or potential customers that the AI agents interact with. These are individuals or representatives from organizations that are part of your sales or engagement pipeline. Prospects can be engaged through various channels and their interactions are tracked and managed within the system.

## Hive
Hive is Trata's knowledge base system that serves as the AI agent's source of information. It can process and understand content from various sources including:
- PDF documents
- Text files
- Word documents
- Websites (via URL crawling)

The Hive system processes these inputs to create a structured knowledge base that AI agents can reference during conversations.

## Action
Actions are integrations with third-party services that AI agents can trigger during conversations. These allow agents to perform tasks like:
- Updating CRM records
- Scheduling meetings
- Sending emails
- Creating tickets
- And other custom integrations

Actions help bridge the gap between conversation and actual business processes.

## Conversations
Conversations track the actual interactions between AI agents and prospects. Each conversation maintains a complete history of the communication, including context, responses, and any actions taken during the interaction. This allows for analysis, improvement, and continuity in prospect engagement.

## Files
Files represent the documents that can be uploaded into the system. These could be training materials, reference documents, or other content that needs to be processed and added to the Hive knowledge base. The system supports various file formats including PDFs, text files, and Word documents.

## Connection
A Connection represents the communication channel configuration used to make calls or establish contact with prospects. This entity manages the technical details needed to establish and maintain communication
